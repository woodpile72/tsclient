tsclient Debian package notes
============================

The Cinnamon panel applet that ships with tsclient is installed both under
/usr/share/tsclient/cinnamon-applet (for documentation) and
/usr/share/cinnamon/applets/tsclient@cinnamon so that Cinnamon can detect it
automatically. After installing the package, open Cinnamon’s Applet picker,
search for “Terminal Server Client”, and enable it.
